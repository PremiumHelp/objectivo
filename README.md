### objectivo 
# Xamarin application 

#  Objectivo makes learning a new language so easy and simple. You simply take a picture and it will tell you whats there you just learn visionary. Or if you want to practice sentences you just speak to the app and you will get both the translated text and the original in a second. On the other side if you want to visit another city you just open the phrasebooks and learn the basics, or if you want to get more advanced you will have a list of advanced vocabularies. If you need to translate a huge text to another language for your school project, you just take a picture and it analyzes your text. Its simple and at the same time you can learn from it whatever you wanted to learn during your lifetime.
